# YelpTopicModel
This repo is for analysis of Yelp review dataset.

## topic modelling of yelp review dataset
Use Latent Dirichlet Allocation on the whole restaurant reviews to get 15 topics. The number of topics is chosen by minimizing model perplexity.

## Rating prediction
Practice several basic supervised models (logistic regression, naive Bayes, random forest etc.) for multiclass classification of the stars. Practice LSTM and GRU layers for word sequence models.

## wrapping up results for web application
Develop simple web app that let users to select topics of reviews for certain restaurants and predict ratings of user input text.
